        Sentence #2: One or more specific accomplishments or skills from your career to show employers what they can expect from you if hired for their open position.
        Sentence #3: Additional skills or certifications you think help separate you from other candidates, such as a related license or online certificate.
        You should write a json output of summary.
        The flow of sentences should be smooth and readable.
        No bullet points please.
        No third person voice please.
